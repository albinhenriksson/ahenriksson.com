# ahenriksson.com

This is the source code for [ahenriksson.com](https://ahenriksson.com) â€“ my personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator.

## ðŸ›  Tech Overview

- **Static generator:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- **Theme:** [HugoTeX](https://github.com/YourThemeAuthor/HugoTeX) (included as a Git submodule)
- **Deployment:** Built static files live in `public/` and are served via nginx.

## ðŸš€ Run Locally

To run the site locally, install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:albinhenriksson/ahenriksson.com.git
cd ahenriksson.com
hugo server -D
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`.
