Hey there!

If you're curious about who I am, what I do, and what I've been up to in life 💻🔧 — my **CV is now publicly available** on GitHub!

👉 Check it out here: [https://github.com/albinhenriksson/cv](https://github.com/albinhenriksson/cv)

It's written in **pure Markdown** – clean, readable, version-controlled, and 100% fluff-free. Perfect if you live in the terminal, use `git`, and like things tidy.
