I've made the source code to this website public!

If you're curious about how it's built, want to fork it, steal some ideas, or just poke around, you can find everything here:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/albinhenriksson/ahenriksson.com](https://github.com/albinhenriksson/ahenriksson.com)

It's a simple Hugo site with a custom theme, a few tweaks, and no unnecessary fluff. Built with love, caffeine, and way too much time spent tweaking `config.toml`.

Enjoy, and feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find something broken (or want to add something weird).
