# 💻 Who am I?

---

> *"Experienced and versatile IT Systems Specialist with a strong academic background in physics and mathematics."*

With over **15 years** of hands-on experience in **Linux and Unix-based systems**, I’ve worked on everything from personal homelabs to complex **enterprise infrastructure**. My strengths lie in:

- 🛠 **Systems Administration**
- 🧱 **Infrastructure Engineering**
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity**
- ⚙️ **DevOps Methodologies**

I take pride in **understanding systems holistically**, spotting bottlenecks, and designing **secure, scalable, and performant** solutions.

Formerly a **science teacher**, I also bring a knack for **clear and effective communication** — translating complex technical ideas into something anyone can understand.
